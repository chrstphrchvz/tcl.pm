NAME
    Tcl extension module for Perl5

DESCRIPTION

    The Tcl extension provides a small but complete interface into libtcl
    and any other Tcl-based library. It lets you create Tcl interpreters
    (as perl5 objects), bind in commands to them (either perl subroutines
    or C functions dynamically loaded with the DynaLoader extension) and
    execute Tcl code in those interpreters. There is a Tcl::Tk extension
    (not to be confused with "native" perl5 Perl/Tk extension) distributed
    separately which provides a raw but complete interface to the whole of
    libtk via this Tcl extension.

    Using "tcl stubs", module could be built even without tcl-dev package
    installed on system. Still, tcl (or tcl/tk) must be installed during
    module build. --nousestubs also supported. Tcl versions 8.4, 8.5, 8.6
    and above are supported.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Do not tweak Makefile.PL, rather - specify parameters to Makefile.PL.
Use --help option to find out supported parameters to Makefile.PL:

   perl Makefile.PL --help

Usualy, you do not need any parameters, default ones should be fine.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

See License, Authors sections in Tcl.pm, or with 'perldoc Tcl' - once it
is installed - to have acknowledged on this type of information.
